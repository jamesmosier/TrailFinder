About Trail Finder v0.1
-----------------------
Trail Finder is an application that uses geolocation (a users current GPS location) and gives them feedback, telling them the closest trail heads to them at that location. 
Trail heads can be found most often at parks and towpaths and are typically for walking or riding a bicycle. 

Libraries Used
--------------
Trail Finder uses many open source libraries to do cool stuff...
1. jQuery 
2. Google Maps API
3. Google Fusion Tables API
4. Bootstrap 3.0

Code Information
----------------
Currently, Trail Finder uses very basic technologies. It is written in Javascript/jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. It queries data from Google Fusion Tables to populate the map and list of locations. 
There is a Legacy folder that contains old code that either didn't work or was deprecated. The main folder structure contains the root (i.e. index.html) and three folders: CSS, JS, & img. 

Google Fusion Table setup
-------------------------
The API can call any number of fields from the Fusion Table and place those fields at a specified location.
The most basic setup is "Name" and "Location". "Location" is a set of coordinates (i.e. 41.0731, 81.5178).
